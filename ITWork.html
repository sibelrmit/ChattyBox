							<h1>IT Work</h1>
							<h3>Interviewing an IT professional from NAB</h3>
							<p>Raymond is an IT professional from NAB, what he does as an IT professional is that he supports the NAB dealing room. NAB dealing room is where the team tracks down worldwide currency and commodity movements. In terms of this he/ they deal with applications, networks, accounts (specifically the dealers accounts or workers on their floor), hardware and software support as well as troubleshooting the system. Mainly help users in the working spot, where everything has or needs to be immediately actioned, this can be hardware failure or software issues that do not work that needs to be fixed as soon as these problems occur. Issues with their machine or account issues like the ability to access the dealers account or any account.</p>
							<p>The people that Raymond deals with or interact with are the dealers in the dealing room. (example the important people), he also supports and deals with users within the floor as his role is a floor-based role. In his role they tend to spend time that can be internal like in the office at NAB head office or remotely. Raymond also helps others or every user on their floor as it's a floor-based role. According to Raymond they also support another region like Adelaide and Perth IT professionals. They do interact with each other from other regions and do support more people that are outside their floor. They do internal and remote support, and deal with their dealing room floors.</p>
							<p>During his job time they also tend to travel interstate to support other teams or other dealers in different regions this could be in Adelaide or in Perth. According to Raymond Sydney has their own team but they do interact with each other and help each other out. The challenge in his job is the understanding of the applications like what the application does this is because there are so many applications within the organisation around 100 applications, and the challenge is getting familiar with and understanding where the fault can be or what the fault can be in the applications.</p>
							<p>In terms of helping the users to get back to the working order as quickly as possible. As well as individuals use their own applications, and if these individuals have problems with their applications, they tend to overcome the issues within the time frame that they have.</p>
							<p>Lastly according to Raymond they do a bit of everything at NAB in other words they support every angle, every aspect of the IT problem and cover a bit of everything at NAB head office building.</p>
