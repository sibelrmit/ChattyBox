							<h1>Clouds, Services & Servers</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic29.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>What does it do?</h2>
							<p>The cloud is commonly referred to multiple servers that are connected to the internet and the software and databases that run on those servers (Cloud Flare n.d.). Typical cloud-based services include data hosting, data sharing, web hosting and software use. Cloud computing on the other hand is the use of cloud services to provide on-demand availability of computing resources, power and storage via the Internet (Anderson 2014). This includes storage, servers, databases, networking, analytics, software and intelligence. There are typically three main types of cloud services. These are: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) (Microsoft Azure n.d.).</p>
							<p>Infrastructure as a service: With IaaS, you hire the IT infrastructure which include servers and virtual machines, storage, networks and operating systems. The cloud infrastructure then can be used to build applications.</p>
							<p>Platform as a service (PaaS): PaaS provides an on-demand environment to develop and manage software applications. This makes it easier for developers to be able to create web or mobile apps without setting up or managing the infrastructure of servers, storage network and databases that is required for development (Ranger 2018).</p>
							<p>Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS is the delivery of applications as a service. Rather than installing an application on a device, SaaS applications are accessed and hosted on cloud servers.</p>
							<p>Instead of owning and maintaining IT infrastructure, companies can use cloud computing services and pay for only when they use it which reduces costs in relation to investment and maintenance of hardware and are able to scale depending on the demands of the business (Ferkoun 2017). Backing up data used to require physical drives, manually collecting them and dispatching to a backup facility which introduced some risks due to issues that may potentially occur between the originating and the backup site. With the cloud, you can now automatically dispatch data to any location with a minimised possibility of issues relating to its availability or security. With files and information also being able to be stored in the cloud, they can be accessed, stored and retrieved at any time via the internet (Ferkoun 2017). Cloud computing can also be used to be able to leverage big data analytics. There is a vast amount of data where cloud computing can be used to be able to support the extraction of information from consumer purchasing behaviours in order to target advertising to consumers (Ferkoun 2017). The use of the cloud’s advantages will be able to improve marketing for businesses thus improving revenue.</p>
							<p>Also, with the development of 5G networks in the next coming years, it will bring a significant change to cloud computing (Compare the Cloud n.d.). The development of 5G networks will make technology innovations more efficient when they rely on the cloud. The improvement of speed, service reliability and cloud availability will see applications maximise their potential. This will improve many industries that will be using mobile cloud applications such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, banking etc. 5G technology will allow cloud service providers to be able to reach customers easily and reliably. Mobile apps and applications which are cloud dependent, combined with the implementation of the 5G network improving speed and reliability will mean faster, smoother transfers than the current 4G network. Also, virtual machines using phones will become much more common and will be able to offer more features and options to mobile users. Hotspots will be much faster which allows remote workers access to cloud services even where there is a weak Internet connection (Compare the Cloud n.d.).</p>
							<p>This will cause an exponential growth of traffic in the future due to a higher number of user terminals, more usage of Internet devices and more powerful devices. With this growing demand, it requires the need for scaling possibilities in mobile networks which can be supported by the cloud (Wübben et al. 2014). As a result, this will make technology innovations more efficient when they are dependent on the cloud due to its smoother communications (Compare the Cloud n.d.).</p>
							<p>  </p>
							<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
							<p>At the moment, cloud computing is still in an early stage of adoption (Ranger 2018). Currently, there are many developments that use the cloud which has made a significant impact on today's society. Chatbots such as Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant are all cloud-based natural-language intelligent bots that have been used to improve daily life. They use cloud computing services in order to provide personalised chats with customers. Other programs include Skype, Whatsapp, Microsoft Office which all use the cloud infrastructure that allows you to access your information anywhere (Anurag 2017). This already has made a significant impact on our society and has made life more convenient as well as improving business efficiency and capabilities. With many emerging technologies and trends to come in the future, cloud computing will play an integral role in providing the resources to support these trends. Such emerging trends include machine & deep learning which requires the cloud as a platform due to its advantages including a pay-as-you-go model and easy access to computing resources. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms require a large amount of computing power and external data sources, which is easier and cheaper to acquire using the cloud. Several companies are currently providing AI-related services via the cloud such as IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, AWS Deep Learning AMIs and Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine etc (Buyya et al. 2018).</p>
							<p>In the next decade, new technological advancements will bring about significant new requirements such as large-scale heterogeneous IoT and sensor networks which will produce substantial amounts of data streams to store, manage, and analyse. These requirements will introduce a number of new challenges in cloud computing and will be creating the need for new approaches and research strategies thus creating jobs that will be able to address these new challenges. This development will force us to re-evaluate existing systems and procedures and develop new strategies to address the issues of scalability, resource provisioning, and security (Buyya et al. 2018). With the development of 5G, it will benefit a number of industries from healthcare, banking and automotive as previously mentioned. Innovations such as smart homes as well as smart cities will revolutionise the way we live and will require the use of cloud resources to be able to operate efficiently. 5G’s features will revolutionise the current environment, allowing for several applications that the current network and infrastructure cannot handle. The 5G technology will promote cloud business investment through its widespread application to a large number of innovations (Compare the Cloud n.d.).</p>

							<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
							<p>The development of cloud computing and services will make it very convenient for my daily life. Currently, storage on my physical devices such as my phone and laptop are limited, and with the use of cloud storage, it is a great way to store my files and I am able to expand my storage without worrying about any capacity limits. It is also secure and allows me to access my files at any time, on any device. Previously, when my phone storage was full and started to slow down, I would end up buying a new phone. With cloud storage capabilities, it will free up space on my phone allowing it to run more efficiently. Also, if I do end up losing my device, I will not have to worry about losing my files as well as they are securely stored. Location tracking apps, home automation systems and voice assistants which all rely heavily on the cloud will make my life much easier and convenient as well. Google maps is an application I use a lot of the time when I’m travelling, and the development of cloud services will make improved algorithms and real-life traffic data that will help me to my destination no matter where I am in the world.</p>
							<p>Cloud development will improve many technologies such as wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT). This will make life more convenient for me with voice-activated software such as controlling lights, music or searching for information. I am able to turn off my light with just a voice command rather than going to the switch light to turn it off manually. It will also provide personalised services to me such as music, news and advertisements that are relevant to me. Also, it will help communication between my friends and family become much more efficient as improved cloud services will help provide smoother communication with no lag or interruptions. This will also improve communication in my work life as video communication such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams will now be temporarily the main form of communication due to the current lockdown restrictions.</p>
