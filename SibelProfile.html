							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I  am studying my first year at RMIT University doing a Bachelor of IT. My birthday is in September, and I am 19 years old. My religious background is Muslim and my ethnicity is Turkish and Albanian. I am bilingual, being able to speak Turkish and English. I love the beach and summer is my favourite season! I am an extrovert and enjoy going out with my family friends. I enjoy reading, cooking, travelling and being active.</p>
							<h2>Personality Tests</h2>
							<p>The Myers-Briggs test told me that my personality type is the 'Protagonist'. According to the online results my strengths are: tolerant, charismatic, reliable, altruistic and a natural leader. My weaknesses include: being overly idealistic, too sensitive, too selfless, having fluctuating self-esteem and struggling to make tough decisions. The website states that protagonists are able to thrive in many diverse roles at any level of seniority. The emotional intelligence test I took confirms that I have a lot of social awareness, which is backed up by my results in the Myers-Briggs personality test, that explained that protagonists are very social, empathetic and charismatic people. This means I am adaptable to my surroundings and different groups of people, very self aware and confident, and great at self management. In contrast, this personality trait tends to be a perfectionist and can easily stress themselves out. I must be aware that everything cannot be perfect, and let work be able to be handled and done by others in their own way. According to the VARK questionnaire, my learning style is multimodal meaning I am a flexible learner and can learn in many styles. The results show that I predominantly prefer hands on learning where I can learn from participating in activities and trial and error, which is referred to as kinaesthetic learning style.</p>
							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p>My ideal job would be a Senior Consultant in Data Platforms and Advanced Analytics. The job stands out to me as I will be involved in numerous exciting projects across a wide range of customers. They are looking for engineers who also enjoy being hands on with relational data stacks like Microsoft, and the big data technology stacks like Spark, Hive and Python, which is tech based and what I am looking for. Additionally, the role is centred on leading and management, and using agile methodology to deliver great outcomes to clients, meaning it will require proficient social and management skills. Management and leader positions stand out to me because I enjoy the accountability and the idea of leadership and the delivery of outcomes to customers and clients. The job also offers training in the latest technologies, regular team event and the ability to reach out to vendor experts, meaning I have room to grow and develop. Lastly, the job does also offer a desirable salary as I aim to be successful and earning a lot in my future.</p>
