							<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has the team’s opinion of their ideal jobs changed? Why or why not?</h2>
							<p>Sibel: My ideal job of being a Senior Consultant in Data Platforms and Advanced Analytics is more something I would like to work toward and get promoted to. Hence why my opinion hasn’t changed much since viewing the burning glass data. However, it has shown me what job titles are most in demand giving me more ideas of what other jobs are out there and in high demand. I have also discovered that software development, engineering and design is another ideal job of mine as I enjoy programming, and jobs like systems engineer, network engineer and software engineer are all part of the top job titles. I will be able to find more jobs and roles in IT engineering because it is a very broad and needed area of IT. JavaScript programming is also the second highest in demand IT skill, which is required for program engineering.</p>
							<p>Mylaad: My ideal job is becoming a Software Engineer/Developer and I want to work hard to achieve it. After viewing the burning glass data, it has encouraged me to work even harder to achieve my goal since it is one of the top ranking jobs that are in demand. It has also demonstrated that since it is ranked 1st, I will have to compete with many people that want to become a software engineer/developer. The burning glass data has also motivated me to work in my own time to learn programming languages of Python, Java and SQL. Learning these programming languages in my spare time will give me an advantage when applying for an opening position.</p>
							<p>Aliyah: My ideal job is becoming a Data Analyst and or Software Developer is something that I want to work towards and mostly becoming a Senior Data Analyst or a senior developer later on in the job. Therefore, after viewing the burning glass data, it demonstrated to me that I really want to work towards becoming a Data Analyst or Software Developer as it’s ranked 1st and 4th. Though this will be very hard due to it being in high demand and having to compete with many other people, I still want to work my way through to my ideal job. The data also shows me that I need to work on my skills in SQL as it’s ranked highest in the specific skills that are required by the employers. Discovering that data science is one of the top 3 IT skills, also encourages me to work my way through computer science and data science.</p>
							<p>Thomas: My ideal job is becoming an augmented reality/virtual reality tools engineer preferably at the company oculus. Viewing the burning glass data did not deter me from striving for my ideal job in any way because i did not want to become a x-reality tools engineer because of how much demand it has. I chose it because it is something that I find interesting and would enjoy doing. However the burning glass data did show me that it would be a good idea to have SQL skills on the side just in case I need it in the future for whatever reason.</p>
							<p>Phannavy: After viewing the data from Burning Glass and comparing the results with data from recent years, it made me unsure of my current ideal job, seeing as the position of Director is not something commonly sought after but rather a position you progress to, however the skills/positions currently in demand present new opportunities that I can use as a gateway’ to get to my desired job position; the data focuses on the basic foundations I may need to improve on to obtain my ideal job in the future.</p>
							<p>Johnny: As the results show, I am pretty introverted and possess an analytical mindset where I am able to think abstractly and in complex ways. My results of my learning style show that I am a visual learner. It is best for me to learn by sight through making flashcards, writing down key ideas, or colour code things.  I generally prefer to work autonomously. When forming a team, I am pretty flexible with whoever I get, however I would like a person who is a bit extroverted to be able to balance out our team.</p>
