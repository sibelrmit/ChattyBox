								<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
								<p>There are a lot of similarities with each team member's ideal jobs. Firstly every job requires a University degree and IT/computer science qualifications. Every job requires IT and technical knowledge and experience, however each job requires it at a different level. Johnny’s ideal job is more business related, so it requires a  less extensive IT skill set in comparison to Mylaad’s and Phannavy’s jobs which requires an exceptional IT skill set with extensive experience. Otherwise all roles require IT knowledge and expertise. Some jobs require more client interaction than others, and drive with the purpose of client deliverables and satisfaction. Moreover, some jobs also require more project and team based work than others that are more individual work based. All of the jobs are looking for hard workers with great people skills, with the ability to communicate efficiently, work in teams, and lead and manage projects, teams, deliverables etc. Three years is the minimum years of experience required across all roles, with the exception of Phannavy’s requiring seven plus.</p>
								<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
								<p>As a group, we believed we did a good job working together to complete our assignment. We all communicated with each other effectively to ensure that we were on top of things. We allocated tasks to members from the start of the project to ensure that it is done efficiently, and so that each member can start on their activity and complete it simultaneously. We also completed our allocated tasks in time and we all put in a lot of effort to complete the workload. There were no implications or issues between group members and it was great to see us from different degrees and experiences coming together to provide different insights and knowledge. What worked well was that every group member put in effort into their work and showed that they had lots of prior knowledge and were also keen to learn more. Additionally, group members filled each other in if they missed anything and on their work progress. Definitely one of the biggest challenges we faced as a team was deciding on which project to undertake. However, through discussion via meetings, we were able to come to an idea that we all agreed on. Microsoft Teams was also a great tool to manage our communication, workflow and keeping everything organised. We were able to send our files on there, re-watch our meetings and read any missed conversations.</p>
								<p>What could be improved was our team meetings. Some meetings could not be attended by team members due to conflicting schedules that were unavoidable such as work commitments and other classes. However, we worked around this by writing down notes on what each member had to do on Google Docs and letting the team member know what they missed out on via Microsoft Teams chat. Moreover, the meetings we did have allowed us to discuss our assignment in depth and any current challenges that we needed to address and overcome. </p>
								<p>One surprising thing we learnt from working as a group was how each group member had their own unique working style. Some member’s strengths would accommodate another's weaknesses.</p>
								<p>One thing we have learnt about group work was the importance of communication. Without communication and reminders we would not have been able to overcome challenges and issues that arose during the course of the project. Such examples were mentioned previously such as deciding which IT project to undertake. We all voiced our thoughts, ideas and concerns for each of our individual IT projects which ultimately led us to come to an agreement on our IT Project idea to bring to life. By having effective communication between our team members, we were able to build a strong team relationship and work together to finish our assigned tasks with confidence.</p>
								<p></p>
								<h2>Individual Reflection</h2>
								<p>Sibel: The group communicated with each other well and asked questions and assisted each other when needed. Like for example, once a group member was done with their individual task, they worked with another team member on their task to help them out and get it done faster. However, we did not have many group meetings as needed because it was very difficult to get a time slot when all the group members were free as each member had outside commitments and other classes on at different times. So having commonly occurring meetings is something we could improve on. Additionally, the delay in the delivery of some of the tasks resulted in the possibility of not meeting the assignment deadline so I ended up having to tackle additional tasks on my own. The group treated me as the group leader and came to me for advice and help which was flattering. I learnt that group work within a large group is quite intense because there are more people to communicate with, manage and organise, however because there are more members it is easier to get work done. I was responsible for getting the website done while others worked on their tasks, as I finished my task before everyone else, so the Github activity log will be only me.</p>
								<p>Thomas: I was happy with how this team functioned while doing the assignment. One thing people did very well was communication, we were able to utilise many platforms to communicate such as Google Docs, Microsoft teams and messenger. People were able to have tasks relegated to them and have them completed in a reasonable amount of time. One obstacle the team faced was each individual member’s conflicting schedules. One thing I was pleasantly surprised about was the amount of work six people were able to produce during a short amount of time. Members had many outside commitments such as full time work and moving houses. This led to meetings being hard to schedule, some meetings not everyone was able to attend. However we were able to fill the members who could not attend in by communicating through messenger. One thing I learned was that working on a team is very important because I was able to have many people’s point of view on a specific task.</p>
								<p>Mylaad: </p>
								<p>Phannavy: As a group we were able to figure out and assign tasks quickly from the start which gave a sense of direction for this project and allowed the group to progress smoothly. Everyone completed their tasks as to what was expected of them and on time. Communication between each member was efficient, everyone was considerate of each other’s opinions towards the project idea and how to go about certain aspects of the assignment; there was no discord between members which also contributed greatly to the team’s production. Organising team meetings was something we could have improved on since it would clash with people’s schedules which made it a bit difficult at times to try to get at least everyone on at the same time, however it wasn’t anything detrimental as we were able to resolve that issue by informing them later about updates to the project. One thing being in a group has taught me is the importance of communication and how team members are willing to assist in areas that others might be struggling with, as long as everyone was informed, the group found solutions to deal with the issues at hand which showed the pro-activeness of the team.</p>
								<p>Aliyah: </p>
								<p>Johnny: What worked well in this team was that everyone knew what they had to do and we had all trusted each other to complete their assigned tasks. Communication between all of us was great and there were no implications between team members which was great to see. We used a number of resources and tools to communicate with each other such as Microsoft Teams, Google Docs, Facebook Messenger and Email. One thing that could be improved was the team meetings as some meetings could not be attended by team members due to conflicting schedules that were unavoidable such as work commitments or other classes that they had to attend to. However, we did fill in the team members who had missed out and rearranged the team meeting to be able to try and accommodate everyone's availability. One thing I learned about groups is that it is definitely much better than working on a project alone. We all had our own weaknesses and strengths that mixed very well in the team. One team member’s weakness would be another’s team member’s strength. An example would be that I’m not great at leading a team, however another team member was great at it.</p>
