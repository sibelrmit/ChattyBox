							<h3>Chatty Box The Chat Bot!</h3>
							<p>As many websites face angry reviews on new user interfaces, it causes concern for the companies reputation with their relationship with customers. It is very essential to keep the audience satisfied while they're browsing your website and what better way to do that than a chatbot that answers customer questions in a more simple and efficient manner. This project will be made up of creating a universal FAQ Chatterbox that detects speech-to-text and text-to-speech questions in a variety of languages, in addition to regular text and option choosing conventions that chatbots offer. Working with Centrelink, we aim to reduce the number of customer calls their offices receive and eliminate customers having to wait in call queues for extended periods of time to get the help they need. The purpose of the project is to enhance Centrelink’s ability to connect and efficiently communicate with their customers and cater to customer needs much better.</p>
							<p>According to smallbizgenuis "88% of online shoppers say they wouldn’t return to a website after having a bad user experience"(Julija, A 2020). This is a prime example of why we are partaking in this project. We believe customers deserve the best experience possible when getting in contact with Centrelink and that customer inquiries should be efficiently communicated and solved. As a tech team and regular online users, we have discovered many problems within a variety of websites that turn a blind eye to user experience and satisfaction and ignore customer feedback and negative reviews. We hope to achieve our goal of creating an easier online experience for all websites, and especially Centrelink who has a large customer population that seeks help and advice on a daily basis.</p>
							<p>Our chatbot has been designed with the purpose to be inclusive and help the wide range of customers websites have. Some customers have impairments which can inhibit their ability to use websites and applications efficiently. Sometimes customers don’t have any impairments or difficulty accessing websites and using applications, however they may have trouble; understanding what information is presented, finding information, navigating pages and may just be seeking general help and assistance. Because of this, customers end up contacting helplines to get needed help and support, even for simple matters, because they cannot interpret the wealth of information available on the website or may have impairments inhibiting their abilities and calling to verbally express their needs is much easier and efficient, despite the long and excruciating hold/wait time. This also results in numerous overwhelming calls to the Centrelink departments and help lines, and the chatbot feature can help greatly reduce the stress on Centrelink’s help services.</p>
							<p>The design of the chatbot will be simple to not overwhelm users with clutter and clashing colours. As the point of the chatbot is to aid users, making its design difficult to understand and navigate defeats its purpose. Light colour schemes will be used against darker counterparts to contrast between visual elements to create a balanced interface where visual elements are easily distinguishable from each other, such as foreground and background. This makes it easier for users to follow and interpret the interface and makes it more aesthetically pleasing. The chat box will be part of the website and available on every page. It will be placed to the bottom right side so that it doesn’t take up the whole Centrelink website but is easily spotted also following chat box conventions. Upon first access of the website a notification will pop up to inform users of the chatbot feature, and once the notification is dismissed it will remain as a small pop up in the bottom right corner. It can be minimised to a message icon like how FaceBook has messenger on their website, and then easily clicked on to open the chat box with the chatbot.</p>
							<p>The chat box will look like a message box, like usual chat boxes do, and introduce itself as “Chatty Box, your virtual assistant” with written text and spoken sound. Chatty Box the chatbot will also ask the user how it can help, with written text and spoken sound, to cue users that it is working and ready for assistance. Doing this also sets a positive attitude and environment with users, creating a positive and safe environment for users to make them feel welcome and comfortable. Additionally, popular customer questions and options will be displayed for quick help. Otherwise, if these do not fit what the user needs assistance with, the user can type out their queries like a message, or click the microphone button, located next to the textbox where messages are written, to open speech-to-text to speak their queries and questions. With this the user simply speaks their question and it also appears as text in the chat box messages. Then the chat bot replies to the user's query as a written text message which it also speaks as it is sent. Users have the ability to click the chatbot’s response and hear it spoken to them again and again, in case they have missed any information the first time round. This is extremely helpful for users with eye impairments, muscle difficulty and arthritis, and the ability to speak english but not write it efficiently. The placements and design of these buttons will be easily seen by the users creating a positive first impression on the capability and usability of the chat box.</p>
							<p>As one of the unique features of this chatbot is being universal, there will be a translating section within the textbox that will detect different languages from text as they're typed in the chat or spoken. The translating aspect of this project will answer each question in the language asked by the user. This will solve many problems of online user's with English as their second language.</p>
							<p>While setting up the chatterbox with a website, it will be programmed to answer as many questions as possible, this will be achievable by analysing the website and it's most generally asked questions. There is always room for improvement, so answers and questions available will always be worked on and updated to optimise user experience, and the chatbot will be updated accordingly.</p>
							<p>As a question is asked through text or speech, the chatbot will detect the answer to the question through previous set Q&A, if the answer is incorrect, there will be an option under the answer that will redirect the user to a different website. For example; the user wants to know the payment methods for the current website, however the chatterbox gives the incorrect answer by stating the price of the product. An option will be available asking "Not what you asked for?", if the statement is clicked or the spoken answer is “yes”, the chatbot will ask the question again, present options of other ways it can help or present the user with contact information such as email and number to contact, and users will be informed that emails will be responded to as soon as possible through an automated reply. After each interaction with the chatbot, an option to give feedback will be available and the user will be presented with a pop up review to answer.</p>
							<p>The main technologies that are required to run a chatbot are as follows: Artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). An AI-driven chatbot can use data to learn to deal with users and continually improve their systems over time. This is what allows the bot to adapt to the users' needs and ultimately give them the most accurate response to their queries. Natural language processing is the required foundation of language recognition. There are two main components within NLP that are necessary to understand natural language speech and text-based commands: the first being Natural Language Understanding (NLU) followed by Natural Language Generation (NLG). NLU involves plotting the user’s input and analyzing the various aspects of the language, whereas NLG handles and converts the unorganised data into structured forms producing a response that has meaning in it. In order for the chatbot to understand the user’s inputs, there are five main steps necessary for our NLP to do, the first being lexical analysis, that identifies word structures and divides texts into chapters, sentences, phrases and words. The second, syntactic analysis, analyses the grammar and rearranging of the words so the sentences are relative and coherent. The third, semantic analysis examines the meaning of the text and maps out syntactic constructions relative to websites' jargon and the topics surrounding it, then the last two, discourse integration and pragmatic analysis interpret the text of the user’s message in relation to the overall context.</p>
							<p> A large challenge for NLP is understanding the  complexities of the human language. Elements of speech such as idioms can confuse the bot since it can have a literal meaning and a figurative meaning. For example the idiom “piece of cake” figuratively means “very easily done”, however the chatbot might recognise it as a literal piece of cake. Other language elements such as similes and metaphors can also confuse the bot since the same word can also be understood. The use of these technological methods allows the bot to decipher and derive meaning from the user’s text inputs. The natural language processing is what gives the illusion of a human’s presence behind the bot and allows the answers to be tailored personally to the user.</p>
							<p>The outcome of this project will create a positive interaction with users and drastically improve Centrelink’s customer and user’s experience, as well as improve the number of calls flooding Centrelink’s helplines and services. It gives the chat box the chance to expand on the solution and research to impress users with prompt, customized answers. The impact on this development will have less dramatic experiences and less emotional exhaustion after difficult service interactions. This will have a huge effect on different chat box and chatbot features, that will realise that user-interface is an essential part of a website and can be improved by just one chat box.</p>
