							<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic31.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>What does it do?</h2>
							<p>Machine learning is the ability of a machine that allows a computer to learn from experiences and statistical data without needing to be explicitly programmed to do so. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence, this area is still rapidly growing with what it can achieve and help humans achieve more, making it state of the art. Although machine learning sounds very daunting, the truth is anyone with a computer is able to run and use machine learning code. However, the strength of the computer’s graphics processing unit will heavily affect the speed that machine learning is done.</p>
							<p>An example of machine learning being used is the YouTuber named CodeBullet . Codebullet uses machine learning in many creative ways such as letting his computer learn how to play games such as “2048” (CodeBullet 2018) and “Hill Climb Racing” (CodeBullet 2018). In his Hill climb racing video, he allows his computer to learn to play the game through the algorithm called the “genetic algorithm”. The algorithm was coined this because how it works is inspired by Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution (Vijini, M 2018), where the fittest are selected for reproduction. In a similar fashion CodeBullet allowed there to be 150 play throughs in each generation, the ones that would make it the furthest would be allowed to move to the next generation and so on. It only took 3 generations for the machine to learn to play the game perfectly. Another example that machine learning is used is in Chess. A computer is able to learn and play chess in two ways. One way is for it to play countless games against itself while assessing which position gives itself the biggest advantage. A computer was able to teach itself chess in 72 hours with just the knowledge of the basic rules of the game by constantly playing against itself (Emerging Technology from the arXiv 2015). It was astonishingly able to play at an international master level (top 2.2% of tournament chess players) and if given more time might be able to learn to play against and beat players of a super grandmaster level such as the likes of Magnus Carlsen.</p>
							<p>The other way that a computer is able to play chess is through brute force calculations, otherwise known as the “min-max algorithm” (Cornell n.d.). This is basically when the computer calculates every possible move of the current board, every possible move after taking one of the moves and so on while attempting to minimise the opponents score and maximising its own. However, the limitation of this method is its sheer level of processing power required to calculate each position fast enough. The first time a chess computer surpassed human capabilities was in 1997 when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov under tournament rules. It was reported Deep Blue was searching up to 200 million positions per second while Kasparov was searching a max of 5 moves per second. Although this might sound like a massive gap between the two, Kasparov was able to play at a similar level to the computer (albeit a little lower) because he was only considering the best 5 moves that he could see. To aid this problem, an algorithm called “Alpha-beta pruning” (Cornell n.d.) was developed. Through this algorithm, the supercomputer is able to rank all possible moves in a particular position from best to worst and prune the moves that would yield the less favourable continuation of the game.</p>
							<p>This would mean that the supercomputer would only continue calculating the best continuations, therefore reducing the amount of moves needing to be examined significantly. This has allowed humans to reach a whole new level of chess since top players are able to have a chess computer analyse and give the best move in a given position. According to Keno Fischer, CTO at Julia Computing, “Machine learning is a very rapidly moving field, so it’s hard to make predictions about the state of the art 6 months from now”(Keno Fischer 2019). Although it is hard to predict what we will be able to achieve in 3 years with machine learning. Something we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more robots in the future carrying out business operations, hence why businesses across the globe are adopting robotic techniques to increase their productivity.</p>
							<p>  </p>
							<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
							<p>Machine learning is currently being used in many businesses to increase their productivity. One way it is being used is by targeted ads. Nowadays people are giving out more data to their phones than they think, their phones and other electronic devices are able to pick up data such as what they are searching and location. A machine is then able to analyse all the data then learn about a user’s traits and behaviours then target ads that other people with similar traits and behaviours.</p>
							<p>Although this practice can be seen as wrong and unethical, it has helped many businesses get their ads out to the right potential customers and ultimately increased sales and such. Machine learning can also help in security and help detect fraud. By building models based on historical data such as transactions and such, machine learning algorithms are able to use pattern recognition to spot anomalies in data in real time. For example, if a bank account were to record a user’s bank account being used in a different country as what it is being used normally, the machine learning algorithm would be able to instantly detect it and flag it to a worker to check out.</p>
							<p>Machine learning will affect the large majority of people in the world whether it be targeted ads or through other things such as chat boxes like Siri/google. This will create more jobs in the machine learning sector because machine learning will be more and more in demand. However, it will also make some jobs such as some sectors of finance since it can be done through machine learning.</p>
							<p>  </p>
							<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
							<p>A way machine learning has affected me is through the board game chess. When i play a chess game online, a machine learning algorithm is able to analyse my game using millions of games worth of data and determine what I did well and what i could have done better. Through this I am able to learn chess to a higher level as I am able to see what the best move in a given position and give me an explanation as to why. Another way machine learning has affected me is through ads. Every day I go on the internet I see ads of things that I searched up the day prior. This could be dangerous for me because it will make me money on things that I don't really need. Another way machine learning has affected me is through chat boxes such as google and Siri. Being able to talk to Siri to turn on an alarm and google to turn off my lamp has made trivial tasks like these simpler.</p>
							<p>My parents have recently gotten into using the internet and things like Facebook a lot more. I’d imagine that they would also be affected through targeted ads as well. Everyone in my family uses websites such as YouTube and Netflix, these services record everything we watch and genres we like and dislike in order to recommend the most relevant videos and movies to our tastes.</p>
